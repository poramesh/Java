	/*There are like four kind of application that can be created using java programming.
	 * 1. standalone applicaiton - they are also known as desktop applications or window applications.
	 * these are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. eg- antivirus, media player.
	 * 2. Web application - an application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is web application. 
	 * 3. enterprise application - an application that is distributed in nature such as banking application etc. it has advantages 
	 * like high level security, load balancing, and clustering. 
	 * 4. mobile applcation - its an application which is created for mobile devices. we got android and java me for creating this app.#

	/* java is a object oriented programming language. everything that is in java is a object. 
	 * object oriented means we organise our software as a combination of different types of 
	 * objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
	 */
	/*OOP is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by
	 * providing some rules. basic concepts of OOPs are 1. object, 2. Class, 3. Inheritance, 4. Polymorphism, 5. Abstraction, 6. Encapsulation 
	 */
	/* Java is platform independent because it is different from other languags like c, c++ etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines 
	 * while java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. 
	 */
	/* primary objective of java is to make it portable, simple and secure programming langaugae. it is simple, object oriented, portable, 
	 * platform independent, secured,robust, architecture neutral, intrepreted, high performance, multithreaded, distributed, dynamic.
	 */
	/* uses runtime environment of its own unlike c++ where it uses run time environment of OS.
	 */
	/*classloader in java is a part of the java runtime environment which is used to load java classes into the java virtual machine 
	 * dynamically. it adds security by separating the package for the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported
	 * from network sources.
	 * security manager determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
	 * bycode verifier checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects. 
	 */
	/* Java is ROBUST as it uses strong memory management. there is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems. 
	 * java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the JVM to get rid of objects which are not being used by
	 * a java application anymore.
	 */
	/* Java is ARCHITECTURAL NEUTRAL because there are no implementation dependant features for example, the size of primitive types is fixed. 
	 * in c programming, int occupied 2 bytes in 32-bit architecture where 4 bytes of memeory for 64-bit architecture. however,
	 * it occupies 4 bytes for both 32 and 
	 * 64 bit architecture in java
	 */
	/*
	 * java is PORTAL because it facilitates you to carry the java bytecode to any platform. it doesn't require any implementaion.
	 */
	/* Java is MULTI-THREADED, where a thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. we can write java programs that deal with many tasks at once
	 * by defining multiple threads. the main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesnt occupy memory for each thread. 
	 * it shares a common memory area. threads are important for multi- media.
	 */
	/* Java uses both compiler and interpreter. Java source code is converted into bytecode at compilation time.
	 * The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output. Java is interpreted that is why it is platform-independent.
